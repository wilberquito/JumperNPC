# :anger: Jumper NPC prototype

This project and its different versions has made use of [mlagent-learn](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) to make the npc to learn some policies.

The project is due to a subject (TAIA) of the degree that asked us to present a work related to artificial intelligence and I took advantage of it to learn more about Unity and have more knowledge to enrich the final degree project which will be a video game.

If you are interested in the explanation, the documentation of this project is in docs branch, search for TAIA_REPORT.pdf, it is in Catalan.
