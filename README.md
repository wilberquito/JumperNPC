ðŸ’¢ Jumper NPC prototype
This project and its different versions has made use of ml-agents to make the npc to learn some policies.

The project is due to a subject (TAIA) of the degree that asked us to present a work related to artificial intelligence and I took advantage of it to learn more about Unity and have more knowledge to enrich the final degree project which will be a video game.
